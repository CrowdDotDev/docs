# ðŸ”Ž What is crowd.dev?

crowd.dev is a **developer data platform (DDP)** that lets companies centralize all touch points developers have with their product and brand - be it in community (e.g. Stack Overflow or Reddit), product (open-source or SaaS), or commercial channels (e.g. HubSpot).

crowd.dev pulls data from a variety of different sources, normalizes it, matches identities across platforms, and enriches it with 3rd party data. The result is a unified 360-view of who the developers are that engage with your product and community, which companies they work for, and where they stand in their personal customer journey.

crowd.dev is open-source, built with developers in mind, available for both hosted and self-hosted deployments, open to extensions, and offers full control over your data.&#x20;
