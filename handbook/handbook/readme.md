# What is crowd.dev?

crowd.dev is an **open-source **~~**customer**~~** developer data platform** that helps developer-facing companies to centralize community, product, and commercial data in one place.

Essentially, crowd.dev pulls data from a variety of [different sources,](https://www.crowd.dev/integrations) normalizes it, matches people's identities across platforms, enriches it with 3rd party data, and provides a unified 360-view of all touch points developers have with your DevTool brand and product. These touch points can range from a comment on Hacker News over a new issue on your GitHub repository to a sign-up to your SaaS version.&#x20;

By using crowd.dev, you get a full picture of who the developers are that engage with your product and community, which companies they work for, and which touchpoints they had along their customer journey so far.

Crowd.dev is completely built with developers in mind, for hosted and self-hosted deployments, open to extensions, and with full control over your community's data.&#x20;
