# What is crowd.dev?

crowd.dev is an **open-source developer data platform** that helps developer-facing companies centralize community, product, and commercial data in one place.

crowd.dev pulls data from a variety of [different sources,](https://www.crowd.dev/integrations) normalizes it, matches people's identities across platforms, and enriches it with 3rd party data. The result is a unified 360-view of all touch points developers have with your DevTool brand and product.&#x20;

These touch points can range from a comment on Hacker News, to a new issue on your GitHub repository all the way to a sign-up to your SaaS product.&#x20;

By using crowd.dev, you get a full picture of who the developers are that engage with your product and community, which companies they work for, and where they are in their customer journey so far.

crowd.dev is built with developers in mind for both hosted and self-hosted deployments, open to extensions, and with full control over your community's data.&#x20;
