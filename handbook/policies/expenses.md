# 💰 Expenses

### What can I expense?

* **Co-working space** fees (please get approval from Jonathan first)
* **Hardware** you need to work (e.g., mouse, desktop, headphones)
* **Travel** expenses (e.g., accommodation, travel fares, legal document expenses like Visas)
* **Benefits** related (e.g., co-working space, courses, books, home-office set-up)

### How do I submit an expense?

Depending on whether you are employed directly through Crowd Technologies GmbH (the German entity) or through Remote, there is a different process. Regardless of which please:

* Where possible ask for your team lead's approval (Jonathan or Joan).
* Keep receipts/invoices to be able to submit an expense.
* Note that expenses need to be submitted 10th of the month to be paid out with your salary of that month, otherwise it will happen in the next.

#### Germany (**Crowd Technologies GmbH**)

Write an email to **accounting@crowd.dev**. Please include in email:

* Subject line “Expense Request: EXPENSE NAME”
* A short description of what it is and amount
* Attach receipt

#### Outside Germany (Remote)

1. Log into Remote.com
2. Go to “Expenses” on the sidebar
3. Press “Add expense”, fill out the request and upload your receipt
4. You will get an email from Remote either confirming or denying your expense request
