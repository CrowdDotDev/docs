# ðŸ‘·â™‚ Ways of working

[crowd.dev](http://crowd.dev) is remote-first, but that doesnâ€™t mean we lack collaboration or contact throughout our day. We are building a company around communities, so naturally itâ€™s important to us that our internal community and ways of working are thriving.

#### Freedom & Ownership

Two of our core-values. In short, we believe that everyone knows how and when they work the best, so with the exception of few regular meetings, we leave that up to you. What we really care about is that you get the work done you committed to and take ownership over it (oh yes, and that you have reliable internet access ðŸ˜‰).

#### Our working cadence & meetings

* **1 week cycle with a friday review call:** The product team works in 1-week cycles & Read Joanâ€™s blog on [project-led development here](https://www.notion.so/crowd-dev-Home-8abbb224bd7941e4866e930002ed5b3c?pvs=21)
* **Async daily standups:** please post these daily before 12pm CET using the Geek bot slack bot in #daily-standup. We follow the usual structure of what did you do the day previously, what are you planning to do today, and do you have any roadblockers. Try and link your tasks to the realted linear tasks or Notion to-doâ€™s to make it more clear for everyone else in your team.

#### Our thoughts on meetings

When it comes to work meetings, we believe that good meetings are brief and impactful. Each meeting should have a clear goal in mind and have a context, asks, and action items. Of course, this is for work meetings only and doesnâ€™t apply to our regular social calls. ðŸ™‚&#x20;

If you find yourself in a meeting where you can neither contribute nor learn anything, please just give or write a quick note and drop off. Life is too short for wasting your time in pointless meetings.
