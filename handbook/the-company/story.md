# Story

### January 2021 - The beginnings of crowd.dev 🐣

Before crowd.dev, our Co-Founder and CEO, Jonathan, was responsible for Go-To-Market at a DevTool company. This included understanding the full developer user journey from initial interest, to community engagement, to avid usage and sales. He was soon frustrated that the work required him to switch between endless platforms and work with incomplete data. He also realized there were no tools available that had all the integrations and features he needed for the developer space. So he started working on his own solution.

### July 2021 - crowd.dev is officially founded 🎉

Working on a solution that was making his own life more manageable, Jonathan figured out that other companies struggled with the same problems. So he teamed up with Joan (Co-Founder, CTO), who himself was an avid community member of several open-source communities, and they decided to found crowd.dev. They also started to think about the future and that crowd.dev should be open-source. This would allow us to build a strong developer community around crowd.dev that could add use cases to the software.

### December 2021 - The team starts to grow, and so does demand 📈&#x20;

After releasing our first MVP, it was clear that there was interest. Developer-focused companies found crowd.dev and signed up for the alpha version. At the same time, Jonathan and Joan started to build out our team with the first engineers.

### October 2022 - €2.2m in funding to execute the roadmap and grow the team 💰

To incorporate all the valuable feedback from early users, it was time to bring in external funding to accelerate the building process. We found supportive and knowledgeable investors who believed in crowd.dev's mission to be the developer data tool of choice for developer-focused companies. With that, crowd.dev hired more passionate individuals to keep the momentum going and grew the team to 10 people.

### November 2022 - Releasing an updated product and open-source offering 💡&#x20;

We released our open-source product into the world with enhanced applications and features to help DevTools collect and understand their developer data. We have a strong belief that our open-source approach will create value beyond our own product offering. We want to collaborate with everyone to build software for the developer-led era and create a vibrant and open ecosystem around our project. If you want to go far, go together. We are excited about what the future will hold!

### 2023 - Nail strong product-market fit 🎯&#x20;

The goal for this year is to nail strong product-market fit. Many companies are already happy customers of crowd.dev and use our product on a daily basis.&#x20;

### 2027 - The leading developer data platform for developer-first companies 🏆&#x20;

Watch this space.&#x20;
