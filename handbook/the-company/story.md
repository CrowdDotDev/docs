# 📖 Story

### January 2021 - The beginnings of crowd.dev 🐣

Jonathan (Co-Founder, CEO) was responsible for building up a developer community at a DevTool company. He was soon frustrated that the work required him to switch between endless platforms and work with incomplete data, not really bringing back value to the business. During this time, he also realized there were no tools available that had all the integrations and features he needed for the developer space. So he started working on his own solution…

### July 2021 - crowd.dev is officially founded 🎉

Working on a solution that was making his own life more manageable, Jonathan figured out that other companies struggled with the same problems. So he teamed up with Joan (Co-Founder, CTO) who himself was an avid community member of several open-source communities and they decided to found crowd.dev. They also started to think about the future and that a critical tool, as community management is, should be open-source. This would enable to, over time, form a strong developer community around crowd.dev that could add use-cases to the software.

### December 2021 - The team starts to grow, and so does demand 📈&#x20;

After releasing the first MVP, it was clear that there was interest. Developer-focused companies found crowd.dev and signed up to the alpha version in numbers. At the same time, Jonathan and Joan started to build out the team with the first engineers.

### October 2022 - €2.2m in funding to execute on our roadmap and grow the team 💰

To incorporate all the valuable feedback from early users in our community, it was time to bring in external funding to accelerate the building process. We are super happy that we found supportive and knowledgeable investors who believed in our mission to be the community tool of choice for developer-focused companies. With that, we hired more passionate individuals to keep the momentum going and grew the team to 10 people.

### November 2022 - Releasing our updated product and open-source offering 💡&#x20;

We released our open-source product into the world with enhanced applications and features to help our users achieve their goals. We have a strong belief that our open-source approach will create value beyond our own product offering. We want to collaborate with everyone building software for the community-led era and create a vibrant and open ecosystem around our project. If you want to go far, go together. We are excited about what the future will hold!

### 2023 - Nail strong product-market fit

The goal for this year is to nail strong product-market fit. Many companies are already happy customers of crowd.dev and use our product on a daily basis.&#x20;
