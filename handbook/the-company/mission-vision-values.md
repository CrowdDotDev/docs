# 🎯 Mission, Vision, Values

### 🧭 Mission

**To put community at the heart of business and connect 100 million people by 2030.**

Building communities essentially means building connections between the people in them. We want to foster the connection between like-minded peers, businesses to their users and businesses with each other to create value.

### 🔭 Vision

**In the future, everything will centered around communities. We want to be at the forefront of this development and help make the business world more community-driven.**

Communities enable businesses to build products people love and be truly customer-first. However, community building is still in its infancy in the business world and most do not extract the power of their community. Our desire is to be the go-to tool and single source of truth to make communities a sustainable growth engine for all businesses.
