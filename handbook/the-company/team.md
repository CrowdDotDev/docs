### Jonathan Reimer (CEO) ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª

Jonathan was born and raised in Germany with 5 siblings.

After being Head of Business Development at Code Intelligence, he went on and advised several open-source and developer-focussed companies before starting crowd.dev together with Joan. Besides running the company, Jonathan is doing a lot of sports, listening to (and playing) electronic & hip-hop music, and traveling.

After realizing that was not for her, she completed a Master of Management at ESCP in Berlin and Paris with a focus on entrepreneurship and worked at a MedTech Startup.
