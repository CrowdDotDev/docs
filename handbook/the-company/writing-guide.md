# ðŸ–Š Writing guide

On this page you'll find our tone of voice as well as some additional writting rules we would like everyone at crowd.dev to follow. This is especially important for external pieces e.g., website copy, social posts, blogs, etc. For grammar and spell checking we also use Grammarly, if you need access please reach out to Charlotte Schmitt.&#x20;

## Grammar & spelling

### American spelling & grammar rules

* We use American spelling, not British. For example, we write center not centre, organizations not organisations, and color not colour.&#x20;
* We use the serial comma (also known as the "Oxford comma") which is placed before and after the last item in a list of three or more things. For example, I went to the gym Monday, Tuesday<mark style="color:red;">**,**</mark> and Wednesday.&#x20;

### Punctuation (headings, subheadings, bulletted lists)

#### Headings:

* Don't use full stops.

#### Subheadings:

* Use full stops when its a sentence.
* Don't use full stops when its not a sentence.

#### Bulleted lists:

* Use either all full sentences in your bullet lists or all fragments. Avoid a mix.
* Use a period or other full stop after every bullet that is a sentence. (Just like this bullet list youâ€™re reading now.)
* Use a period after bullet list that completes the opening stem sentence that introduces it.
* Donâ€™t use a period after bullet lists that are not complete sentences or do not complete the opening stem sentence.&#x20;
* Donâ€™t use semicolons to end punctuation.
