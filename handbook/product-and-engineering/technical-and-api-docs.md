# ðŸ–¥ Maintaining technical and API docs

### Technical docs

Technical docs will be heavily linked to [areas-of-ownership.md](areas-of-ownership.md "mention"). The owner of each technical area is responsible for it being well-documented enough such that other experts can stay in the loop by reading the documentation, and learners can grow into the area.&#x20;

Technical docs should be written in the [#technical-docs](technical-and-api-docs.md#technical-docs "mention") section in the public documentation. Owners of technical areas can create a page and subpages (with up to one level of nesting) for their documentation.

#### Guidelines

* Keep docs up to date! If you make a significant change or refactor, do not merge it before you have updated the documentation. Otherwise, your teammates will not be able to work with your changes.
* Use graphics when needed. You can create and export them using Miro.
* Feel free to record Looms for specific sections. Always use voice and camera when recording Looms for docs.
* Always use Grammarly to ensure your writing is clear and grammar is correct.

### API docs

API docs will be imported from Postman, so we only need to keep Postman up-to-date. Then, Joan will sync Postman to documentation every Tuesday when releasing.
