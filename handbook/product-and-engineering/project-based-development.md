# ⚒️ Project-based development

### What does it mean to work with project-based development?

The majority of the work will be planned, iterated, and developed within projects. Each project will be associated with a major goal and will represent a sub-goal that can be properly tracked, with a clear finish line.

If a task or given work contributes to one of the product's major goals, or require a more detailed structure and discussion, then it should reside within a project. All other tasks can be handled outside of projects and discussed in the cycle planning meeting if needed. If you are unsure whether to create a task in a project or outside, discuss it with your product lead.

### Why did we choose project-based development?

1. Contextualized scoping and discussion;
2. Increased involvement from the team in managing their own work;
3. Improved control over the start and end dates of a product goal (improvement or feature);
4. Improved visibility of projects within a roadmap;
   1. [Linear roadmap](https://linear.app/docs/roadmaps)
5. Improved status updates.

### What should a project have?

1. **Name**: (Major Goal) Sub-Goal title
2. **Health** updates
   1. Refer to [how-to-give-status-updates.md](how-to-give-status-updates.md "mention")
   2. [Linear project updates](https://linear.app/docs/project-updates)
3. Project **lead**
4. **Start and Target Date**
5. **Milestones** (if applicable)
6. **Associated team and roadmap**
7. **Scope document**
