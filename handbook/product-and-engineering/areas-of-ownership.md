#### What does it mean to be an owner?

As the owner of a segment, your responsibilities include:

* Ensuring quality.
* Coming up with ideas for improvement and suggesting them, with arguments, in our planning meetings.
* Freedom of decision-making to drive the area forward.
* Being the first point of contact for support tickets in that area.
* Management of other teammates that might be working with you.
* Communicate decisions to the rest of the team.
* Ensure that your co-owner is always up-to-date and that other experts have the most updated knowledge. You should do this through documentation, following our [communication.md](../ways-of-workiing/communication.md "mention") guidelines.

#### Other roles

* **Co-owner**: the co-owner acts as a temporary owner when the owner is unavailable. As a co-owner, you should ensure you are up to date with topics in that area and comfortable with the code.
* **Expert**: an expert on an area can tackle most tasks without much, or any, external help.&#x20;
* **Learner:** someone that wants to develop in that area. It can be through pair programming or attending workshops at first and taking small tasks later.
