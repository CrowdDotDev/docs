# ü•≥ Welcome to crowd.dev (WIP)

Before you head into your first day, take a few minutes to reflect for yourself: 

- What would you consider a successful onboarding/start at [crowd.dev](http://crowd.dev)?
- What would you like to have achieved after 3 months?

You will then reflect on this together with your team-lead in the first one-on-one.

# Day one

Today is about getting you immersed in all things [crowd.dev](http://crowd.dev) and making sure you have access to everything you need.

There are a few meetings that should already be in your google calendar:

- 10am CET Welcome with one of our founders
- 4pm CET ‚ÄúTea Time‚Äù with a team member (you will have one with each of us in the next 2 weeks)

- Go throgh our handbook. Here you will find everything from our company vision, mission & values, ways of working, reporting issues...
