# ðŸ‘·â™‚ Side-projects

We believe spending some of your free time building products and offering services in other areas of interest is awesome. We want to encourage entrepreneurship and personal growth, but we have a simple process that we ask everyone to follow:

When considering starting a side hustle, please check in first with Jonathan or Joan. Give a brief description of:

* What you are planning to do
* Approximate number of hours per week, including whether they are at fixed times or are flexible
* Potential conflicts of interest

We will try our best to accommodate this. However, we must make sure that the side project does not interfere with your job at crowd.dev. Overall the baseline is: If your side project doesn't effect your work at crowd.dev - great, we'd love to support it!
