# ðŸ‘·â™‚ Side-projects

We believe it's healthy to spend some of your free time building products in other areas of interest, but we do have a simple process we ask everyone to follow.&#x20;

When considering starting a side hustle, please get first approval from Jonathan or Joan. Give a brief description of what it is along with the following information:

* Approximate number of hours per week
* Is it commercial? For example, a paywalled Saas.
* Is it time sensitive, or does it require you to be focused on it during strict hours?

We will try our best to accommodate this. However, we must make sure that the side project does not interfere with what crowd.dev needs, so we cannot guarantee that we will approve every project.
