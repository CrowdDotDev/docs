# ðŸ˜· Sick days

If you are feeling unwell and would like to take the day off, please let your team lead know (Jonathan or Joan) and mention it in your daily standup. In cases where possible, do let us know the day before.

If you are sick longer than 2 working days in a row we ask you to get a doctors note and send them to Charlotte (charlotte@crowd.dev).
