# üóù Values

We differentiate between our core values, aspirational values, and permission-to-play values.

### Core Values

Core values are our fundamental beliefs.

#### Openness

We believe that the future of business is open - be it code, data, or communication. Just like this company handbook, we try to include everyone for transparency and efficiency. This is also key to our success as a remote-first company.&#x20;

#### Human-first

We put humans first and prioritize the well-being of our people over everything. We spend so much time at work, so we want to make sure it gives you energy and purpose. We also think of our users first and empathize with their needs to build an outstanding product.&#x20;

#### Ambition

We strive for greatness in what we do and never settle for the status quo. Building a start-up is no walk in the park and we want crowd.dev to be around for a long time. To do that, we need to bring our A-game and improve all the time.&#x20;

#### Freedom

We give everyone full freedom to decide when, where, and how they do their tasks. We all have a life outside of work and that might mean different things and times for everyone. As long as we honor commitments and show up to the few meetings we have, we give everyone free reign.&#x20;

#### Ownership

We hold ourselves accountable and measure our work by the results we deliver to our users. Clear ownership helps us work better and faster. We each own up to our failures just as much as our successes, and know we won't be judged by our teammates.&#x20;

### Aspirational Values

Aspirational values are what we want to embody along with our core values, but we are not quite there just yet and can do better. Let's keep them top of mind and work toward them.

* True **Customer Obsession** in everything that we do
* **Diversity** in our team
* **Consistency** in shipping high value features
* **Social responsibility** and giving back to our community
* **Data driven** decision-making in all our teams and departments&#x20;
* Have **Grit** and keep going for the long haul

### Permission-to-Play Values&#x20;

Permission-to-Play values are minimum behavioral and social standards required of any team members. We‚Äôll need to sit down and have a tough conversation when someone violates any of these values.&#x20;

* Respect
* Honesty
* Inclusiveness
* Professionalism
* Reliability
* Open mindedness
* Team play
