# ðŸ—£ Meetings

When it comes to work meetings, we believe that good meetings are brief and impactful. Each meeting should have a clear goal in mind and have a context, asks, and action items. Of course, this is for work meetings only and doesnâ€™t apply to our regular social calls. ðŸ™‚&#x20;

If you find yourself in a meeting where you can neither contribute nor learn anything, please just write a quick note and drop off. Life is too short to waste your precious time in pointless meetings.

### Async daily stand-ups

Please post these daily before 12:00 pm CET using the Geekbot slack bot in #daily-standup. We follow the usual structure of what you did on the previous day, and what you are planning to do today. Please mention any road blockers that you might have here as well and tag relevant team members. Try and link your tasks to the related Linear tasks to make it more straightforward for everyone else on your team.

### Weekly meetings

* **Cycle review & planning**: Every Friday, the Product team meets for cycle review and planning (60 mins).&#x20;
* **Growth JF**: Every Monday, the Growth team meets for their jour fixe.
* **Design JF**: Every other week on Monday, Nuno and Jonathan meet for a Design jour fixe.

### Monthly meetings

* **All-hands**: In the first week of each month, all team members meet for all-hands. Team leaders share the progress and plans of their departments. Additionally, we share important company-wide announcements.
* **Retrospective**: On the last Friday of each month, all team members meet for a retrospective to reflect on what made us mad, sad, and glad in the last 4 weeks.
* **1:1's:** Each team member will have a monthly 1:1 with their direct manager to make sure they are progressing and both sides have an opportunity to give and receive feedback. These slots are a good time to discuss development opportunities and check-in whether you are reaching your goals. You'll also have a more casual monthly 1:1 with the Chief of Staff to talk about any open-topics in another dynamic.&#x20;
* **User insight sessions**: Led by Design and Customer Support, these monthly sessions help keep us on top of user feedback and requests and make sure our backlog and roadmap is reflecting current needs.&#x20;
