# How to estimate issues

Estimating the time an issue will take is important to plan our weeks efficiently. To estimate issues, we use a Fibonacci-based approach:

* 1 point: it will take at most half a day
* 2 points: between half a day and a day
* 3 points: between one and two days
* 5 points: a week, with other tickets or support
* 8 points: a whole distraction-free week

Issues that might need to be done the following week should always be estimated before the cycle review on Friday. If you own a project, ensure the issues that might be tackled during the cycle are estimated.

Joan might assign you standalone issues to estimate. Those estimates have to be done before the cycle review meeting. Once done, you can unassign yourself.
