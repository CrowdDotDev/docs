# Values

We differentiate between 3 different sets of values: core values, aspirational values, and permission-to-play values.

### Core Values

Core values are our fundamental beliefs.

#### Openness

We believe that the future of business is open - be it code, data, or communication.

#### Human-first

We put humans first and prioritize the well-being of our people over everything.

#### Ambition

We strive for greatness in what we do and never settle for the status quo.

#### Freedom

We give everyone full freedom to decide when, where, and how they do their tasks.

#### Ownership

We hold ourselves accountable and measure our work by the results we deliver to our customers.

### Aspirational Values

Aspirational values are what we want to embody along with our core values, but we are not quite there yet and can do better. Let's keep them top of mind and work toward them.

* Customer centricity
* Diversity
* Consistency
* Social responsibility
* Data driven
* Grit
* Community
* Curiosity

### Permission-to-Play Values&#x20;

Permission-to-Play values are minimum behavioral and social standards required of any team members. Weâ€™ll need to sit down and have a conversation when someone violates them.

* Respect
* Honesty
* Inclusiveness
* Professionalism
* Reliability
* Open mindedness
* Team play
