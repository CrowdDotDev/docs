# ‚úç Communication

### Short-term: Slack

Almost all of our internal communication happens in Slack. In general, we try to have as much communication as possible in public channels. Private channels should only be used if it's a private topic or really nobody else needs to be involved (also not potentially later). Thereby, we ensure everyone is in the loop and that conversations are searchable for everybody.&#x20;

The most important Slack channels are:

* \#general - company-wide announcements
* \#dev - everything related to product development & engineering
* \#growth - everything related to our Go-To-Market
* \#daily-standup - see what all team members are working on today
* \#design-review - where our Product Designer posts items for review from involved stakeholders
* \#support - all customer support issues should get posted and discussed here
* \#feedback - a collection of all customer feedback we receive across channels
* \#kudos - cheer for colleagues and appreciate their work
* \#knowledge - a collection of relevant resources like links, whitepapers, videos, etc
* \#share-your-world - share pictures from your workspace, your weekend activity, or anything else that is going on in your live (like an "internal Instagram feed")
* \#random - memes, interesting links, and whatever else you wanna post

### Long-term: GitBook

Long-term decisions and information should always be stored in GitBook, in the relevant sections. It's everyone's responsibility to keep documentation up-to-date so we can share knowledge efficiently.&#x20;
