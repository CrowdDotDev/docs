# Culture

[crowd.dev](http://crowd.dev) is remote-first, but that doesnâ€™t mean we don't have a vibrant culture. We show up to work every day because we love building exciting technology and stand behind our company mission but also to spend time and collaborate with awesome people. We strongly believe that a great team and culture are necessary for long-term success.&#x20;

We make time for coffee chats and game nights and are always looking forward to the next company offsite. We also encourage open feedback and have regular check-ins to make sure we are doing our best to keep our team happy and motivated.&#x20;

Check out our values to see what connects us all and our team page to get to know some of the characters behind crowd.dev.&#x20;
