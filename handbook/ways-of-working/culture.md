# 💝 Culture

[crowd.dev](http://crowd.dev) is remote-first, but that doesn’t mean we don't have a vibrant culture. We show up to work every day because we love building exciting technology and our company mission, but also to spend time and collaborate with awesome people. We strongly believe that a great team and culture are necessary for long-term success.&#x20;

We make time for game nights and coffee breaks and are always looking forward to the next company offsite (every quarter). We have an open feedback culture and have regular check-ins to keep us honest and make sure we are doing our best to keep our team happy and motivated.&#x20;

Check out our [values](mission-vision-values.md) to see what connects us all and our [team page](../the-company/team.md) to get to know some of the characters behind crowd.dev.&#x20;
