# Reacting to emergencies

Emergencies are anything that does not let our users get any value from the app. They cannot log in, the data is not loading, or integrations fail. Integrations are the most common emergency and will be treated separately.

### General emergencies

In a general emergency, keeping a cool head and communicating are essential.

1. When reporting the emergency, open a Slack thread with the ðŸš¨ reaction. When reporting, try to gather as much information as possible so research can be started in the right direction.
2. Research what the owners and/or experts might be failing, and tag them in the thread.
3. If you are an expert, drop what you are doing and start fixing the emergency.
   * If you are out of the office, find another expert.
   * If you are working on another emergency, find another expert or contact Jonathan or Joan to see which one has more priority.
4. Keep the thread up to date to inform others of what you have tried. This way, we will reach a solution together quicker.
