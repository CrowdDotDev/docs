# Home

Home gives you a quick snapshot of what's happening in your community. You can get an overview of the 4 core elements of crowd.dev:

* Members
* Organizations
* Activities
* Active Integrations
* Open tasks

By default, Home displays data for the last 7 days across all connected platforms. Above the membrs element at the top, you can change the time period of displayed data (7, 14, or 30 days) and filter by connected platforms. This will affect all modules on Home except your active integrations and open tasks.

## Filters

filters allow you to filter members, organizations, and activities by platform or period.

* **Period**: You can display data in the last 7, 14, or 30 days
* **Platform**: You can filter data by a specific platform that you have connected.

## Members

* **Total members**: How many members were identified in your community in a given period (7, 14, 30 days)
* **New members**: How many new members joined your community and did the first activity in the given time period. The result is displayed as a number (total new members in a given time period) with a relative change (to the previous time period) and as a graph (new members over a given time period). Below is a feed of the newest members, from which you can jump directly to each member's profile.
* **Active members**: How many members did at least one activity in the given time period. The result is displayed as a number (total active members in a given time period) with a relative change (to the previous time period) and as a graph (active members over a given time period). Below is a feed of recent active members, from which you can jump directly to each member's profile.

## Organizations

* **Total organizations**: How many organizations were identified in your community (all-time)
* **New organizations**: How many previously unknown organizations were linked to at least one new member in the given time period. The result is displayed as a number (total new organizations in a given time period) with a relative change (to the previous time period) and as a graph (new organizations over a given time period). Below is a feed of the newest organizations, including the logo, number of associated members, and number of employees (if available).
* **Active organizations**: How many organizations were linked to at least one activity of an associated member in the given time period. The result is displayed as a number (total active organizations in a given time period) with a relative change (to the previous time period) and as a graph (active organizations over a given time period). Below is a feed of recent active organizations, including the logo, number of associated members, and number of employees (if available).

## Activities

* **Total activities**: How many activities happened in your community (all-time)
* **Activity graph**: How many activities happened in your community per day, displayed as a line chart
* **Overall sentiment**: We analyze the sentiment of all text-based activities - think about pull requests, Discord messages, tweets, etc. This module displays how many positive, neutral, and negative activities we identified (in total & in %).
* **Top activities by type**: It shows which type of activities are most performed by your community
* **Trending conversations**: The most relevant conversations across all platforms. Trending is defined by the number of replies a conversation received in the selected time period. For every conversation, you get insights into the number of participants, replies, and sentiment on each topic.
* **Recent activities**: A feed of recent activities in your community, simply sorted by time and date.

## Integrations

* **Active integrations**: This widget displays all your connected integrations. If there is a green dot next to your integration, it means that your integration is connected. If you notice any other than a green dot next to it it means that your integration failed to connect or needs additional action.

## Open tasks

* **My open tasks**: Any open tasks assigned to you that are yet to be completed, displaying the task title, description, related member(s), assignee(s), and its due date. You can mark a task as completed by checking the circle next to the task name or edit the task by clicking the three dots on the right. You can add new tasks by clicking "Add task" at the top right corner or navigate to your Tasks page by clicking "All tasks".
* **Task suggestions**: When you first set up crowd.dev or have no open tasks, you may see suggestions of community tasks to create new tasks from.
