# Organization views, filters & sorting

We have a few default views of your Organizations page that we think are helpful to most users. These views are based on certain pre-selected filters and sorts. \[block:image] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "https://files.readme.io/9ed86f6-Screenshot\_2022-11-29\_at\_20.12.19.png", "Screenshot 2022-11-29 at 20.12.19.png", 2970, 526, "#000000" ] } ] } \[/block]

Our default views include _All organizations,_ **New & active**, and **Most members**. Within these views, you can also add and create your own filters to further narrow the selection of displayed organizations and sort them.

We made these different views, filters, and sorts to allow you to segment, research, target, and learn more about your community. For example, if you are on the hunt for prospects to be developer advocates you can use views and filters to find the most eligible candidates to individually target. The same for if you are looking for qualified leads to market or sell to and any other use cases you may have.

\#Overview of default Organizations views

* **All organizations**: shows all organizations in your community with no filter or sort applied
* **New & active**: shows new organizations that have been active (filter = number of activities is greater than 1000 AND Joined date: is after 30 days ago)
* **Most members**: shows you organizations sorted by the number of members, without a filter.

\#Organizations filters & sorting You can apply one or more filters at a time to help identify specific organizations based on their attributes. You can also sort the Organizations table by any column that has an arrow symbol next to its name.

To apply a filter just click on **Filters** on the right side of the search bar and click on the filter you would like.

When you apply multiple filters you can apply operators to mix and match different attributes within your filters:

* **And**: Results must match all selected attributes in the filter
* **Or**: Results must match at least one of the selected attributes in the filter

You can filter the Organizations table by the following attributes:

* **# of members**: How many members the organization has in your community
* **# of activities**: The number of activities the members of the organization have done in total.
* **# of employees**: The number of employees the organization has
* **Joined date**: The date the first member of the organization joined your community.
* **Active on**: The platforms the members of the organization are active on.

You can sort the Members table in ascending and descending order by the number of members and number of employees.
