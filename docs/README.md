# ðŸ‘‹ What is crowd.dev?

crowd.dev is the developer data platform (DDP) that lets companies centralize all touch points developers have with their product and brand - be it in community (e.g. Stack Overflow or Reddit), product (open-source or SaaS), or commercial channels (e.g. HubSpot). The platform pulls data from a variety of different sources, normalizes it, matches identities across platforms, and enriches it with 3rd party data. The result is a unified 360-view of who the developers are that engage with your product and community, which companies they work for, and where they stand in their personal customer journey. To get started for free, either [sign up for our cloud version](https://www.crowd.dev/sign-up) or take a look at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CrowdDotDev/crowd.dev).

More than 90% of companies use open-source software. Yet, most of these companies are unaware of the highly relevant commercial offerings of open-source projects. For open-source companies, tapping into this audience is the most significant opportunity for commercialization. What stands in the way? Go-To-Market teams lack needed data across community engagement, interaction with developer docs, and self-hosted deployments.

With crowd.dev, you get full visibility into all platforms and can take action to strengthen and grow your companyâ€™s most valuable asset - your developer community. Self-hosted or hosted by us, with developers in mind, open to extensions, and with complete control over your data.\
