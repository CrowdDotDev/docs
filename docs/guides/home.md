# üèö Home

Home gives you a quick snapshot of key things that are happening in your developer data. You can get an overview of the core elements of crowd.dev:

* Contacts
* Organizations
* Activities
* Active Integrations
* Open tasks

By default, Home displays data for the last 7 days across all connected platforms. Above the contacts element at the top, you can change the time period of displayed data (7, 14, or 30 days) and filter by connected platforms. This will affect all modules on Home except your active integrations and open tasks.

## Filters

filters allow you to filter contacts, organizations, and activities by platform or period.

* **Period**: You can display data in the last 7, 14, or 30 days
