# üèô Organizations

Organizations are companies or entities within your community. If a contact who works at a certain company joins your community, that company will be added as an organization. Usually, you will have more than one contact of an organization in the community. Therefore, this module is key to seeing how a certain organization is adopting your community and product.

In the crowd.dev organizations page you have an overview of all the organizations in your community across the platforms you have connected.

We have automatically added default views of your organizations for easy access; these include **All organizations, New and active, and Most contacts.** You can also apply your own filters to these views to easily find, group, and better understand who your organizations are.

For each organization, you have a set of default details called organization attributes. This includes things like the number of employees, their website, and their social profiles.
