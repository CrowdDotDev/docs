# Organization enrichment

Organization enrichment automatically populates organizations represented in your community with additional data points. When an organization is enriched, you will see valuable details such as company size, industry, description, location, and more.

The enrichment is based on publicly available information.

## How do you enrich an organization?

Organization enrichment is available for users in our Scale and Enterprise plans (find out more about our plans [here](https://www.crowd.dev/pricing)). Once one of these plans is active, organization enrichment occurs automatically.

In our Scale plan, you will have up to 200 automatic enrichments a month, in Enterprise, it depends on your plan. We prioritize companies that are new and whose members are the most active in your community.

## How to see all enriched organizations?

To see which organizations are enriched, you can use the filter "enriched organization" and choose "true" from the dropdown. Conversely, if you want to see organizations that are yet to be enriched, choose "false".
