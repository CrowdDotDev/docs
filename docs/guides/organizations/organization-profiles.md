# Organization profiles

We create an organization profile for every organization within your community. You can navigate to an organization profile by clicking on an individual organization on the organization overview page. In the organization profile, you will see three different sections. The Profile section (top left), the Identities section (top right), and the Contacts and Activities section (bottom left). We will go through each in detail below.&#x20;

### Profile section

The top left section is the Profile section and includes all the background information we have on the organization. This is made up of all the default attributes crowd.dev gathers, which includes the number of contacts, number of employees, revenue.

### Identities

The top right section is the Identities section, it shows the social profiles that we were able to gather for that organization. For now, we support GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Crunchbase.

### Contacts and Activities section

The default view of the bottom left section is the contacts section, which lists all the contacts that belong to that organization. The other tab is the Activities section, which is a summary of all activities that were made by contacts of the organization.
