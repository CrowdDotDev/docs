# App: Eagle Eye

## Introduction

Eagle Eye is built to help you grow your developer community. It monitors 11 of the most popular developer-focused content platforms for posts related to your DevTool. You can then engage with this content and start relationships with your target developer.

Based on the keywords and platforms you choose, Eagle Eye can also send you an email digest with the 10 most relevant posts in your inbox. And if you are struggling to come up with comments for any content pieces, Eagle Eye can generate examples for you with AI.

Invest just a few minutes in Eagle Eye a day, and you can consistently raise awareness of your DevTool and add new members to your community.

### **Engage with content**

If you see content that you want to explore and engage with, press on the content card, and you will be redirected to that post. Read through the post and add a comment or question to start the conversation with developers.

### **Bookmark & share content with your team**

If you want to keep track of the content you have already engaged with, you can press the bookmark icon on the content cards. On the top of the page, you can go to the "Bookmarked" view to see all your bookmarked posts.

So that you and your team can coordinate on engaging with content, you can find your "Team bookmarks" on the top right dropdown of the Bookmarked view.

### **AI replies**

AI replies are designed to help you easily engage with developer content without spending too much time generating the perfect response. When enabled, our algorithms generate suggested replies based on the content of the post you are viewing.

{% hint style="info" %}
The AI replies are just a starting point. We advise you to read the post and add genuine value to your response.
{% endhint %}

To generate an AI reply, click on a post's _Lightbulb_ icon.

AI replies are currently unsupported for GitHub, YouTube, and Stack Overflow. They can be turned off in the settings.
