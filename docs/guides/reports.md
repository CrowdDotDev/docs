**Default reports** are available by default. These reports provide insights and suggestions on specific data points of your communityâ€™s data. While they may not be as flexible as custom reports, default reports offer a good overview of your community and allow you to gather further insights by filtering data, interacting with graphs, and accessing detailed views.

**Custom reports** are fully customizable and allow users to build custom widgets, organize them in any order, and add different data points as needed.

For both custom and default reports, users can also share reports publicly, allowing for further actionable items such as sharing a monthly report with investors.
