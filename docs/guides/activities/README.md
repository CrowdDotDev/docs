# 🏃♀ Activities

Activities are all kinds of actions that contacts do - ranging from entering a Discord server to submitting a PR on GitHub. Activities are basically your all-in-one newsfeed. They give you oversight of who’s saying what and where. We also use activities to calculate your [activity sentiment](activity-sentiment.md) based on the positive or negative language used.

## How to add activities

Activities are tracked automatically once you connect any data source. Take a look at [Integrations ](../../technical-docs/integration-framework.md)to learn how to connect different available data sources.
