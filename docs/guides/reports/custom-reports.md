# Custom Reports

## How to set-up

### 1. Create a new report

We have already created a report called Default Report that you can duplicate and customize for your needs.

If you'd like to create a report from scratch, go to the [reports section](https://app.crowd.dev/reports) and click on **+ New** to create a new report.

Choose a name and decide if the report should be publicly accessible.

### 2. Add widgets to a report

Once you've created a report, you can add as many analytics widgets as you want. A widget can be a graph, a KPI, or a table.

Here is a detailed explanation of the report widget settings:

* **Title**: The displayed name of the widget.
* **Measure**: The main objective of the widget. Currently, you can choose between Contacts and Activities.
* **Dimensions** (optional): Dimensions are various features by which you can sort data - such as the location of contacts.
* **Time Dimensions**: The time axis used to sort the data (if there is a time axis). This currently gets preselected based on your _Measure_.
* **Granularity** (optional): The time intervals in which data gets cumulated - such as days, weeks, or months.
* **Date Range**: The time period that gets considered.
* **Chart Type**: The overall type of the widget. You can choose between different chart styles, tables, and numbers.

Additional Settings

* **Limit**: The maximum number of data points that should be considered.
* **Order**: Different types of sorting.

## Share reports publicly

You can make reports publicly available to share them with team contacts, investors, or your community.

Navigate to the Reports section and click on the 3 dots on the right.

Click **Copy Public URL** to copy the corresponding public URL.
