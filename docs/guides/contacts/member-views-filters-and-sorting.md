# Contact views, filters & sorting

We have a few default views of your Cotnacts page that we think are helpful to most users. These views are based on certain pre-selected filters and sorts.&#x20;

Our default views include **All contacts**_**,**_ **New & active**, **Slipping away**, **Most engaged**, **Influential**, and **Team**. Within these views, you can also add and create your own filters to further narrow down the selection of displayed contacts and sort them.

We made these different views, filters, and sorts to allow you to segment, research, target, and learn more about your community. For example, if you are on the hunt for prospects to be developer advocates, you can use views and filters to find the most eligible candidates to target individually. The same goes for if you are looking for qualified leads to market or sell to and any other use cases you may have.

* **Most engaged**: shows you your most engaged contacts (filter = Engagement level: Fan, Ultra)

* **Team**: shows you contacts that are part of your organization (filter = Team: true)

## Contact filters & sorting&#x20;

You can apply one or more filters at a time to help identify specific contacts based on contact attributes. You can also sort the contacts directory by any column that has an arrow symbol next to its name.

To apply a filter, click on **Filters** on the right side of the search bar and click on the filter you would like.

When you apply multiple filters, you can apply operators to mix and match different attributes within your filters:

* **And**: Results must match all selected attributes in the filter
* **Or**: Results must match at least one of the selected attributes in the filter

You can filter the Contacts table by the following contact attributes:

* **Tags:** Any of the tags you have created for your contacts
* **# of activities**: How active a contact is across your community relative to other contacts.
* **Engagement level**: A score from 1-10 that signifies how active a contact is across your community relative to other contacts (1: Silent, 2-3: Quiet, 4-6: Engaged, 7-8: Fan, 9-10: Ultra)
* **Custom attributes**: Any custom attributes that you created specific to your community.

You can sort the Contacts table in ascending and descending order by the following columns:

* **Contact**: The name of a contact (sort by alphabetical order)
* **First activity**: The first date a contact interacted with your business.
* **Engagement level**: The amount of activity a contact has relative to other contacts.
