# Slack Notifications

Slack notifications allow you to receive notifications in a selected Slack channel. For example, you can configure to receive a message whenever a new contact is detected or a new activity happens in your community. Pick a trigger, set a filter (e.g., only to trigger when the activity happens on Discord), and set it live.

## Connect Slack notifications to your workspace

* Navigate to **Settings** (at the bottom of the lefthand navbar)
* Click the **Automations** view
* Click the **Add automation** button
* If you don't have the Slack app connected, click on the button **Install app**, which will redirect you to the integrations page to authorize the Slack app to your workspace
*   In the Slack authorization screen, select the Slack channel where you want to receive the notifications\

## Create a Slack Notification

* Navigate to **Settings** (at the bottom of the lefthand navbar)
* Click the **Automations** view
* Click the **Add automation** button
* Select **Slack notification**
* Next, you can choose a trigger - an event that will "fire" the notification. E.g, when a user stars your repo, crowd.dev will immediately send you a notification to a selected channel. There are two types of triggers:
  * A new activity trigger: This one fires when an activity happens that you specify, e.g., someone starred your GitHub repo
  * A new contact trigger: This one fires when a new contact is detected
* From the dropdown, select which type of trigger you want to receive notifications for

### To specify a new contact automation

* Choose **New contact joined your community**
* Select a name for this automation
* From the dropdown, choose one or more platforms you would like to trigger this notification for
* Lastly, click **Add Slack notification**

### To specify a new activity automation

* Choose **New activity happened in your community**
* Select a name for this automation
* From the dropdown on the left, choose one or more platforms you would like to trigger this notification for
* From the dropdown on the right, select the activity types you want to trigger the notification
* You also have the option to specify specific keywords that will trigger a notification, for example, you can choose to be notified whenever someone in Discord writes a message including the keyword "community"
* Lastly, click **Add Slack notification**
