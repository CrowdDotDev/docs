# üßëü§ùüßë Contacts

Contacts are the people who have engaged with your product or community. They are the individuals who invest their time and effort in your organization or project, whether it be through engaging with you on Discord, asking a question in Slack, making a pull request in GitHub, or mentioning you on Twitter. You can also manually add contacts.

In the crowd.dev contacts page, you have an overview of all the contacts in your community across the platforms you have connected. A contact is anyone who has conducted at least one activity in your community or one that you have added yourself manually.

We have automatically added some default views of your contacts for easy access, these include All contacts, New and active, Slipping away, Most engaged, and Team. You can also apply your own filters to these views to easily find, group, and better understand who your contacts are. Find out more about [Contact views, filters, and sorting here](../contacts/contact-views-filters-and-sorting.md). So you don't have duplicate contacts in your overview, we also have a [merge function](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/merge-members).

For each contact, you have a set of default details called contact attributes, see here for more information on them. This includes things like the organization they belong to, the # of activities they have made, and the engagement level they have in your community. We have also made it possible for you to add individual [tags](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/member-profiles) and [custom attributes](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/member-attributes-identities) to organize and segment your contacts.
