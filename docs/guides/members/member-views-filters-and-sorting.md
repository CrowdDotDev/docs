# Member views, filters & sorting

We have a few default views of your Members page that we think are helpful to most users. These views are based on certain pre-selected filters and sorts. \[block:image] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "https://files.readme.io/0bf0ae3-Docs\_\_Merge\_Suggestion.png", "Docs\_ Merge Suggestion.png", 1800, 756, "#000000" ] } ] } \[/block]

Our default views include _All members,_ **New & active**, **Slipping away**, **Most engaged**, **Influential**, and **Team members**. Within these views, you can also add and create your own filters to further narrow down the selection of displayed members and sort them.

We made these different views, filters, and sorts to allow you to segment, research, target, and learn more about your community. For example, if you are on the hunt for prospects to be developer advocates you can use views and filters to find the most eligible candidates to individually target. The same for if you are looking for qualified leads to market or sell to and any other use cases you may have.

\#Member filters & sorting You can apply one or more filters at a time to help identify specific members based on member attributes. You can also sort the Members table by any column that has an arrow symbol next to its name.

To apply a filter just click on **Filters** on the right side of the search bar and click on the filter you would like.

When you apply multiple filters you can apply operators to mix and match different attributes within your filters:

* **Or**: Results must match at least one of the selected attributes in the filter

You can filter the Members table by the following member attributes:

* **Tags:** Any of the tags you have created for your members
* **# of activities**: How active a member is across your community relative to other members.
* **Engagement level**: A score from 1-10 that signifies how active a member is across your community relative to other members (1: Silent, 2-3: Quiet, 4-6: Engaged, 7-8: Fan, 9-10: Ultra)
