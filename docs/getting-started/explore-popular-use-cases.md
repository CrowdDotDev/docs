### Spot & contact influential members

To spot and contact influential members in your community, navigate to the Members list and click on the [Influential view](https://app.crowd.dev/members?activeTab=influential). This will show you all members that have more than 500 followers (called “Reach”) combined across the platforms you connected (e.g. Twitter & GitHub). By default, they are sorted by Reach, but you could also go on and apply filters to e.g. only see influential members that joined in the last 30 days or only those that have a high engagement level. \[block:image] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "https://files.readme.io/9dc219b-image\_175\_1.png", "image (175) (1).png", 1600, 1138, "#000000" ] } ] } \[/block] Once you have identified members with high reach, you can try engaging them with a message. To do so, click on on of their identities (e.g. Twitter or Email) and draft a private message. We recommend keeping it short and sweet to increase the likelihood of a response.

Here is an example:

_Hey (name of member),_

_I am (your name) the (your role) of (community name). We’ve noticed you are one of our most involved community members, so we wanted to thank you for your contributions to our community. We really appreciate it! Is there anything I can do to help you?_

### Re-engage slipping away members

To re-engage slipping away members, navigate to the Members list and click on the [Slipping away view](https://app.crowd.dev/members?activeTab=slipping-away). This will show you all members that have a high engagement level (between 7-10) but did not do any activities in your community in the last 14 days. We recommend re-engaging those members, for example, by sending them an email or a Discord message. \[block:image] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "https://files.readme.io/09b409c-image\_176\_1.png", "image (176) (1).png", 1600, 1138, "#000000" ] } ] } \[/block]

### Build an ambassador program

An ambassador program recognizes your community’s most impactful members and helps to reward, activate, and retain them. It can enable you to create a flywheel of education, engagement, and adoption and can also shorten your product feedback loop. With crowd.dev, you can easily identify and manage potential ambassadors.

If you decide to build an ambassador program, crowd.dev can help you with the following steps:1. Navigate to the [Most engaged view](https://app.crowd.dev/members?activeTab=most-engaged) of your community members.

2. Take an in-depth look at the different member profiles. If you decide that you want to add a certain member to the program, reach out to them via one of the provided contacts (e.g. Discord or Email).
3. If the member agrees to join the ambassador program, add a _true_ to the boolean attribute “ambassador program” (you have to create this attribute in the global attribute settings before).
4. Now, you can filter the members in all views and easily track your ambassadors.

### Identify sales opportunities

Identifying sales opportunities in your community allows you to engage directly with your potential customers and gather valuable insights and feedback. While we don't recommend that you conduct the regular sales motions in your community, it can be a good starting point for a conversation.

The best place to identify sales opportunities in crowd.dev is in the [Organizations module](https://app.crowd.dev/organizations). Here you can discover all the organizations that your members are associated with.

To spot very active organizations, you can, for example, use the [Most members view](https://app.crowd.dev/organizations?activeTab=most-members), which sorts all organizations by the number of members they have in your community. Each organization has a dedicated profile view where you can take a look at all the data we collected. \[block:image] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "https://files.readme.io/cb71b3b-pasted\_image\_0.png", "pasted image 0.png", 1600, 1138, "#000000" ] } ] } \[/block]

### Conduct product research

Your community is a great place to do product discovery and learn what people have to say, for example, about certain problems or features you are providing. Crowd.dev is collecting all your communities’ feedback across all platforms and making them easily searchable for you. To conduct product research, simply navigate to the [Activities module](https://app.crowd.dev/activities) and type in a keyword. You can then refine the search results by applying different filters (e.g. sentiment or platform). Here is an example where I looked for activities regarding our “twitter integration” with a negative or neutral sentiment: \[block:image] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "https://files.readme.io/93127cd-pasted\_image\_0\_1.png", "pasted image 0 (1).png", 1600, 1138, "#000000" ] } ] } \[/block]

### Get notified about key community activities

To get notified about key activities in your community, simply navigate to the [Automations tab](https://app.crowd.dev/settings?activeTab=automations) in the settings. Here you can create webhooks for every activity that happens in your community. Simply follow the following steps:

1. Click “Add webhook”.
2. Choose the trigger “New activity happened in your community”
3. Refine the activities that trigger the webhook by applying filters for platform, activity type, or keywords.
4. Define a Webhook URL where the webhook should be sent, e.g. from an automation tool like [Make](https://make.com/).
5. Go to Make and create a workflow with a webhook as a trigger point. You can now use the webhook payload to send a notification to Slack or an email to your team.

If you need help with setting up webhooks, send an email to [help@crowd.dev](mailto:help@crowd.dev).

### Find relevant content to engage with

Our Eagle Eye app allows you to monitor different community platforms to find relevant content to engage with, ultimately helping you to gain developers’ mindshare and grow your community.

Simply navigate to the [Eagle Eye app](https://app.crowd.dev/eagle-eye), type in a few keywords that are relevant to your niche, open the post by clicking on it, and leave a thoughtful comment. After that you can mark the post as “engaged” to keep track of the posts that you engaged with through Eagle Eye. (Hint: this will also help our algorithm to make better suggestions to you in the future.) \[block:image] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "https://files.readme.io/c124f71-pasted\_image\_0\_2.png", "pasted image 0 (2).png", 1600, 1138, "#000000" ] } ] } \[/block]

### Leverage your community to boost organic search traffic

Our Community Help Center app lets you auto-generate a public hub for all your community’s conversations. This will make your community content discoverable by Google and reduce duplicate questions and support effort.

Navigate to the [Community Help Center app](https://app.crowd.dev/community-help-center), follow the general setup steps in the settings, and select “all channels” for the auto-publishing function. Crowd.dev will now sync every conversation in your community with your public landing page. Take a look at [our example](https://open.crowd.dev/crowd).

You can read more about setting up your community help center [here](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/community-help-center#general-set-up).

### Manage your daily community to-do’s

To manage your daily community to-do’s you can leverage the [Tasks module](https://app.crowd.dev/task). Here you can create and manage tasks, relate them to members of your community, and assign them to you or your colleagues. Typical tasks we use are, for example, “reach out to this member regarding ambassador program” or “follow up with member regarding support request on Discord”.

You can also create tasks in a members’ profile view. For that, you only need to switch to the “Tasks” tab and click “Add task”. This will open the same window for task creation.

Learn more about Tasks [here](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/tasks).

### Measure community impact

Measuring impact is important to prove the business value of your community. Our [reporting module](https://app.crowd.dev/reports) helps you to easily tie different metrics together and share them with your colleagues.

By default, you can find an example report in your workspace. Duplicate and modify it to tailor the report to your specific needs. If you want to share a report, simply publish it and copy+paste the public URL. \[block:image] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "https://files.readme.io/278c18e-pasted\_image\_0\_3.png", "pasted image 0 (3).png", 1600, 1138, "#000000" ] } ] } \[/block] Learn more about Reports [here](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/reports-1). \[block:callout] { "type": "success", "body": "Thanks for reading through this. We’d love to hear about your personal use cases for crowd.dev. Please feel free to reach out to use via [hello@crowd.dev](mailto:hello@crowd.dev) or drop a message in our [Discord community](http://crowd.dev/discord)." } \[/block]
