# ‚≠ê Core concepts

Members, activities, and organizations are the core elements of your community. Every community consists of members, activities that those members conduct, and organizations that those members belong to.

## Members

Members are the people who interact in your community. They make your community a community, whether they engage on Discord, mention you on Twitter, or open an issue on GitHub. Members who work for your organization are called "team members" and are generally not considered for counting activities, calculating engagement levels, etc..

crowd.dev automatically creates a member profile for every person who conducted at least one activity in your community. The member profile is the single point of truth for everything related to your members. It gives you a historical view of all past activities, a collection of background information (e.g., location or bio), and tools for organizing your community, like tags. To learn more, visit the [Members section](core-concepts.md#members).

## Organizations

Organizations represent the workplaces of your members. They are currently displayed in your Organization directory and in an associated member's profile. You will be able to track which members belong to the same organization, which organizations are growing strong in your community and in turn would be great Organizations for your Go-To-Market team to contact. Find out more in the [Organiztions section](core-concepts.md#organizations).

## Activities

Activities are everything that is being done by your members and organizations. They are displayed either in the activities feed or in member profiles and include posts, comments, replies, retweets, reactions, and more. Basically, every event that is monitored from any connected data source is considered an activity. There are pre-defined activity types for all native integrations, but you can also add custom activity types. To learn more, visit the [Activities section](core-concepts.md#activities).

## Conversations

Conversations are a collection of activities that belong to each other. They are displayed in the conversations section and include chat threads/reply-chains and forum posts. Conversations can tell you which topics are causing the most engagement in your community. To learn more, visit the [Conversations section](core-concepts.md#conversations).

## Tags

Tags are custom labels that help you to organize and filter your data. If you have a specific segment of members you'd like to focus on (e.g. "conference attendees 2022"), you can apply tags to link them together.

## Attributes

Attributes are custom data fields that you can add to members. They are a powerful tool to store and explore even more community data points. You should use them whenever a single tag doesn't do the job. You can add attributes either through the member's profile or through our API.
