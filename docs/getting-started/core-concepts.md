# ‚≠ê Core concepts

## Contacts

crowd.dev automatically creates a contact profile for every person who conducted at least one activity in your community or whom you add manually. The contact profile is the single point of truth for everything related to your contacts. It gives you a historical view of all past activities, a collection of background information (e.g., location or bio), any notes, tags, or tasks you or a team member has made. To learn more, visit the [Contacts section.](core-concepts.md#contacts)

## Organizations

Organizations represent the workplaces of your contacts. They are currently displayed in your Organization directory and in an associated contact's profile. You will be able to track which contacts belong to the same organization, which organizations are growing strong in your developer data and in turn, would be great organizations for your Go-To-Market team to contact. Find out more in the [Organizations section.](core-concepts.md#organizations)

## Activities

Activities are everything that is being done by your contacts and organizations. They are displayed in the activities feed or contact profiles and include posts, comments, replies, retweets, reactions, and more. Basically, every event that is monitored from any connected data source is considered an activity. There are pre-defined activity types for all native integrations, but you can also add custom activity types. To learn more, visit the [Activities section](core-concepts.md#activities)[.](core-concepts.md#activities)

## Conversations

Conversations are a collection of activities that belong to each other. They are displayed in the conversations section and include chat threads/reply-chains and forum posts. Conversations can tell you which topics are causing the most engagement in your community. To learn more, visit the [Conversations section](core-concepts.md#conversations).

## Tags

Tags are custom labels that help you to organize and filter your data. If you have a specific segment of contacts you'd like to focus on (e.g. "conference attendees 2022"), you can apply tags to link them together.

## Attributes

Attributes are custom data fields that you can add to contacts and organizations. They are a powerful tool for storing and exploring more data points. You should use them whenever a single tag doesn't do the job. You can add attributes through the contact's or organization's profile or our API.
