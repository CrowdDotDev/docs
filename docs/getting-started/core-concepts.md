# ‚≠ê Core concepts

## Contacts

crowd.dev automatically creates a contact profile for every person who conducted at least one activity across your connected data sources. An activity could be, for example, starring your GitHub repo, signing up for your product, or posting something in your Discord channel. Alternatively, you can manually add a contact.&#x20;

The contact profile is the single point of truth for everything related to your contacts. It gives you a historical view of all past activities, a collection of background information (e.g., location or bio), and any notes, tags, or tasks you or a team member has made. To learn more, visit the [Contacts section.](../guides/contacts/)

## Organizations

Organizations represent the workplaces of your contacts. They are displayed in your Organization directory and in an associated contact's profile.&#x20;

You will, for example, be able to track which contacts belong to the same organization and which organizations are growing strong in your developer data, which, in turn, would be great organizations for your go-to-market team to contact. Find out more in the [Organizations section.](../guides/organizations/)

## Activities

An activity is an action by a contact. Activities are displayed on the activities page or contact profiles and include things like posts, comments, replies, retweets, reactions, and more.&#x20;

Basically, every event that is monitored from any connected data source is considered an activity. There are pre-defined activity types for data sources, but you can also add custom activity types. To learn more, visit the [Activities section.](../guides/activities/)

## Attributes (Default & Custom)

Attributes are data fields related to your contacts and organizations. They are a powerful tool for storing and segmenting your data. You can filter your contacts by any attribute and create relevant lists of contacts or organizations.&#x20;

We have default attributes that are already part of each contact or organization profile, for example, "Engagement level" or "Last Active". You can also add custom attributes specific to your organization and needs. You can add attributes through the contact's or organization's profile or our API. To learn more, visit the [Contact Attributes](../guides/contacts/contact-attributes-and-identities.md) or [Organization Attributes section](../guides/organizations/organization-attributes-and-identities.md).&#x20;

## Conversations

Conversations are a collection of activities that belong to each other. For example, a conversation happening in a Slack thread or GitHub PR. They are displayed in the conversations tab on your [activities page.](https://app.crowd.dev/activities) Conversations can tell you which topics are causing the most engagement in your developer base.&#x20;

## Tags

Tags are custom labels that help you to organize and filter your data. Tags may be relevant across a certain subset of contacts and/or organizations. For example, you may create a Tag called "2021 SWAG winner" and tag the contacts you have sent company SWAG to. You can filter for any tags you create in your contacts or organizations lists.&#x20;
