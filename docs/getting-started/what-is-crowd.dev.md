More than 90% of companies use open-source software. Yet, most of these companies are unaware of the highly relevant commercial offerings of open-source projects. For open-source companies, tapping into this audience is the most significant opportunity for commercialization. What stands in the way? Go-To-Market teams lack needed data across community engagement, interaction with developer docs, and self-hosted deployments.

With crowd.dev, you get full visibility into all platforms and can take action to strengthen and grow your companyâ€™s most valuable asset - your developer community. Self-hosted or hosted by us, with developers in mind, open to extensions, and with complete control over your data.
