# Zapier Integration

## How to install

To start using the integration, go to the [Integration settings](https://app.crowd.dev/integrations) and follow the steps to set up Zapier.

## Supported triggers

Triggers are a Zapier way to listen for new events (basically webhooks). crowd.dev's Zapier integration supports two types of triggers: **New Activity** and **New Contact.**

### New Activity

This trigger is activated when a new activity happens in your community platforms connected to crowd.dev. For example, someone starred your repo, sent a message in Discord, etc.

You can make this trigger granular. For example, only activate it when someone opens a pull request on GitHub and mentions a specific keyword. On the other side of the spectrum, you can configure this trigger to be a "catch-all", but this setup is not recommended because it will be quite hard to distinguish between different events on a Zapier side. So the recommended configuration is to keep this trigger as narrow as possible.

### New Contact

This trigger is activated when a new contact joins your community platforms connected to crowd.dev. In crowd.dev, a contact is considered anyone who performed at least one action at your community platforms - e.g., joined a Discord server or did something on GitHub (the trigger is activated only once for each user).

This trigger can be configured as a "catch-all" (all new contact activities for all active platforms) or only for specific platforms.

## Supported Actions

Actions in Zapier are commands that the integration can perform (basically API calls). crowd.dev Zapier integration supports multiple actions:

### Activity

* **Create or update activity for a contact** - _takes a contact object and information about activity and creates or updates an activity for this contact in crowd.dev_
* **Create or update activity** - _takes an activity object and creates or updates an activity in crowd.dev based on sourceId of activity and platform_

It's worth noting, that these actions are intended only for activities from custom platforms not supported by crowd.dev. For example, they can be used to automatically creates activities for contacts who attended a meetup, purchased a swag, etc.
