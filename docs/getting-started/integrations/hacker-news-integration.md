You will see two different input options: mentions and URLs.

* Mentions are the name(s) of your company or community. The more holistic the selection, the better. However, do not make it too broad to not pollute your workspace data.
* URLs are the different URLs that are relevant to your company and community. This could be your homepage, your app, or your GitHub repository...

For example, to track mentions of crowd.dev: \[block:image] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "https://files.readme.io/596ce6f-Screenshot\_2022-11-24\_at\_14.31.40.png", "Screenshot 2022-11-24 at 14.31.40.png", 1546, 1236, "#000000" ] } ] } \[/block]
