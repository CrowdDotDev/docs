# ðŸ¥³ Getting set up

Once you have signed up to crowd.dev, we recommend the following steps to get going:

1. **Connect** your first few [data sources](integrations/).
   * The more data sources, the better. If you go with just one to start, we recommend going with GitHub as it is a rich source for Developer data, which we then enrich with even more data points for you to use.&#x20;
   * Give it a few minutes to populate your workspace, and you will see your contacts and organization pages start to fill up.
2. **Invite your** colleagues to collaborate.
   * You can invite your teammates and give them admin or read-only access.&#x20;
   * If you are not the owner of your company's GitHub account, make sure to invite that person as an admin so they can set up that data source for you.&#x20;
   * Once your colleagues are there, you will be able to collaborate through our Tasks (assign yourself or their tasks), Notes (on certain contacts or organizations), or creating custom views of your contacts or organizations pages shared across your team.&#x20;
3. **Explore** the [contacts](../guides/contacts/) and [organizations](../guides/organizations/) that have interacted with your brand or product.
   * This is where the magic really begins... once your data has been pulled into crowd.dev (make sure to give it a few minutes), you can start digging in.
   * Check out a contact profile to see all of the activities they have made with your brand or product, explore any [additional data points](../guides/contacts/contact-enrichment.md) we have added for you, and see if they are a qualified lead for a sale.&#x20;
4. **Explore** **insights** with our [reports](../guides/reports/).
   * Take a look at our activities, contact, or product-community fit report to find out about key trends like the most active contacts or popular activities in your developer data.
   * Build your own reports with our [custom report ](../guides/reports/custom-reports.md)builder.
5. **Take action** by setting up [Slack notifications or Hubspot sync.](../guides/automations/)
   * We have a two-way sync with HubSpot to make sure your contacts are fed straight to your CRM.
   * To make sure you react to key activities fast, you can set up a Slack notification for example when a new contact has joined.&#x20;
