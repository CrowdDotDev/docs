# Relation between activities and organizations

_Ability to link Activity with Org directly (Ideally, activity object should have a reference to organization, and users should have the ability to affiliate any number of activities to a specific organization than what was defaulted based on start/end date of members affiliation). Activities updated this way should not be updated in the future by auto-affiliation or affiliation changes, can only be updated manually by assigning a different org or removing the associated org from org field of activity._

For this, we introduce a _1-to-many_ relaiton from activities to organizations. This relation should not be updated by upserts. For example:
- Activity _A1_ is upserted as belonging to the organization _O1_.
- The user changes _A1_ to be related to organization _O2_ instead.
- Activity _A1_ gets upserted again as belonging to _O1_. The resulting activity should still be related to _O2_.

We also need to save settings for future activities. This would be at member and segment level. For example, we can say: _for member M1, who belongs to organizations O1 and O2, all activities in segment S1 should be affiliated to O2._ We also need to be able to not affiliate activities for certain segments: _for member M1mall activities in segment S2 should have an empty organization affiliation._ These changes are saved in the `memberSegmentAffiliations` table. These settings have priority in the upsert.

# Segments and project structure

Segments is our terminology for the project structure in the Linux Foundation.

We need to represent three levels of nesting:

- **Project groups**: These are sub-foundations such as CNCF.
- **Projects**: Projects within sub-foundations, like Kubernetes.
- **Sub-projects**: A further granularity of projects, like Helm for Kuubernetes.

One important caveat: each project must have a sub-project with the same name and logo. For example, the Kubernetes project must have a Kubernetes sub-project. Similarly, a sub-foundation must have an identical project and sub-project. This huge advantage will allow us to represent everything in one table.

## What is a Segment?

A segment is the table we use to represent each of the three levels of nesting. It has the following columns:

- `sourceId`: ID of the segment at source (direct requirement).
- `sourceParentId`: ID of the segmentâ€™s parent at source (direct requirement).
- `slug`: A unique slug for the segment in that tenant.
- `name`: The display name of the segment.
- `parentName`: The name of the parent, if any (direct requirement).
- `parent`: Slug of the parent segment, if any.
- `grandParent`: Slug of the grandparent segment, if any.
- `status`: _active_, _archived_, _formation_, _prospect_ (direct requirement).
- `logo`: The URL for the logo.
- `activityChannels`: A list of all activity channels in that segment. Probably to be replaced.

### Example representation

Imagine we want to represent the project group CNCF, with Kubernetes as a project, and Helm and Mini-kube as subprojects:

| **Name** | **Slug** | **Parent** | **Grandparent** | 
|----------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| CNCF | cncf |  |  | 
| Kubernetes | kubernetes | cncf |  |
| Helm | helm | kubernetes | cncf | 
| Mini-kube | mini-kube | kubernetes | cncf | 

These would all be entries in the Segments table.

### Terminology

- **Subproject**: if a segment has parent and grandparent.
- **Project**: if a segment has a parent, but no grandparent.
- **Project group**: if it has neither parent nor grandparent.

## Relations to other entities

- **Members**: _many-to-many_, since a member can belong to multiple segments.
- **Organizations**: _many-to-many_, since an organization can also belong to multiple segments.
- **Activities**: _one-to-many_, since an activity can only happen in one segment.
- **Conversations**: _one-to-many_, since a conversation can only happen in one segment.
- **Integrations, reports, tasks, and notes**: _one-to-many_.

## Querying

With this structure, querying becomes very easy and independent of which level we are at. Given a slug, we need to find all segments with that slug in either the slug, parent, or grandparent fields. Then we can get all rows related to any of these segments.

The segments where we are working are stored in the `repositoryOptions`, which makes the code and integration seamless.
